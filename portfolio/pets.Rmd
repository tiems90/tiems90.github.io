#Intro
Let's try and get some information on pets in Madrid! Fortunately, they have information freely available on `datos.madrid.es`. This will only be a short analysis and we will try to see if we can find some basic patterns in the data. Let's start by loading our libraries. 


```{r Load Libraries, include=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```


#Loading and Cleaning
First we load this data:

```{r Load Data}
url <- "http://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/207118-0-censo%20animales.xlsx"
destfile <- "x.xlsx"
download.file(url, destfile)
x <- read_excel(destfile, skip = 1)
```

Then we preform some basic cleaning. It comes with an empty row, so we remove this. Let's also have a look at the data we have. 

```{r}
x[-22,] -> x
x
```

#Cats vs Dogs
It looks like we only have basic data on how many cats and dogs are within each zone. To check the popularity of each respective choice, let's create a new variable that will be the ratio of dogs to cats. 

```{r}
pets <- x %>% 
  mutate(ratio= `ESPECIE CANINA`/`ESPECIE FELINA`) %>% 
  arrange(ratio)
```

Now we have an additional column that tells us where we have more dogs relative to cats. The higher the number, the more dogs per cat.

Let's plot this. 

```{r}
x %>% 
  mutate(ratio= `ESPECIE CANINA`/`ESPECIE FELINA`) %>% 
  arrange(ratio) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x=reorder(DISTRITO, ratio),
        y=ratio)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=1), colour = 'grey', linetype='dashed') +
  xlab('District') +
  ylab('Ratio Dog/Cat') +
  ggtitle('Dog:Cat ratio per District in Madrid') +
  coord_flip()
```

The dotted line indicates an equal ratio of cats an dogs. We see here that there is quite some difference by zone, and that overall there appear to be a lot more dogs than cats. This could indicate a very strong preference for dogs, relative to cats, or that it's easier to get away with not reporting your cat than your dog for tax purposes...

#Demographic Data
Let's add some demographic data to see if there's any correlation. 

```{r}
library(readr)
padron <- read_delim("http://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/200076-1-padron.csv", 
    ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
padron

padron$total <- rowSums(padron[,9:12], na.rm = T)
padron$weight <- padron$COD_EDAD_INT*padron$total
```

Okay, it seems like we have this data per district, neighbourhoor, and age. Let's aggregate this a bit more.

```{r}
district <- padron %>% 
  group_by(district = DESC_DISTRITO) %>% 
  summarise(
    spanish_men = sum(EspanolesHombres, na.rm=T),
    spanish_women = sum(EspanolesMujeres, na.rm=T),
    spanish = spanish_men + spanish_women,
    foreign_men = sum(ExtranjerosHombres, na.rm=T),
    foreign_women = sum(ExtranjerosMujeres, na.rm=T),
    foreign = foreign_women + foreign_men,
    avg_age = sum(weight)/sum(total)
  )

district %>%
  gather('Statistic', 'Value', -1) %>% 
  filter(Statistic %in% c('spanish', 'foreign')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Statistic, y=Value, fill=Statistic)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  facet_wrap(~district)


```

Now we have some interesting data per district. Time to join this with our previous table.

```{r}
library(fuzzyjoin)
join <- district %>% 
  stringdist_full_join(pets, by=c(district = 'DISTRITO'))
```

This seems to have taken care of the fuzzy merge. But San Blas is being difficult. We will fix this manually. 

```{r}
join[21, 9:12] <- join[22, 9:12]
join <- join[-22, names(join)!= 'DISTRITO']

join$ratio_imm <- join$foreign/join$spanish
```

And we have it complete! Now, can we find a relationship between ratio of dogs to cats and our other variables?

```{r}
lm1 <- lm(ratio ~ spanish + foreign + avg_age, data = join)
summary(lm1)
```

At least in the most basic form this does not appear to be the case. 

```{r}
lm2 <- lm(ratio ~ ratio_imm + avg_age, data = join[,-c(1, 10, 9)])
summary(lm2)
```

And with immigration statistics this remains unclear.
