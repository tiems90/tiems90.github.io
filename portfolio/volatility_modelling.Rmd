#Intro
When I read about an interesting new package, `tidyquant`, that combines the financial packages with the tidyverse, I figured this would be the perfect time for some basic volatility modelling. I figured I would preform some basic analysis on Telefonica stock volatility to start with.

#Data
##Loading Packages
We start by loading our packages. The `tidyquant` package loads the tidyverse as a dependecy, so it should contain all we need. For volatility modelling I opt for the `rugarch` package, which should contain everything I need. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Tidyverse and Quantitative Functions
library(tidyquant) 

#Volatility Modelling
library(rugarch)
```

##Downloading Data

The functionality offered by the package allows for easy downloading of stock data. Furthermore, with the pipe operator, we can immediately transform this data into daily returns. 

```{r}
TEF <- tq_get("TEF", get = "stock.prices", from = " 2010-01-01") %>% 
  tq_transmute(adjusted, periodReturn, period = "daily", col_rename = "returns")

TEF
```

##Data

We start with a quick look at the data to see if we can discern some periods of higher and lower volatility. This is our first quick check to see if an ARCH-type model might make sense.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
TEF %>% 
  ggplot(aes(date,returns**2))+
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle('Daily Squared Returns')
```

The graph definitely shows some periods with higher volatility. For further verification, let's have a look at our ACF and PCF. 

```{r}
pacf((TEF$returns)**2)
acf((TEF$returns)**2)
```

This definitely looks like we can fit an ARCH-type model. In fact, I will opt for a Garch(1,1) model first.

#Modelling
As mentioned above, I use the rugarch package to fit our model. First I will create the model specifications. 
```{r}
spec <- ugarchspec(mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(0,0)), 
                   variance.model = list(garchOrder = c(1,1), 
                   model = "sGARCH"), distribution.model = "norm")
spec
```

Now we fit this model to our data.

```{r}
gfit <- ugarchfit(spec, TEF$returns)
gfit
```

This model seems to fit our data well. For a visual inspection we can plot the volatility to the conditional SD. This will give us an idea of how well the model can identify volatile periods. 

```{r}
plot(gfit, which = 3)
```

I see there are some problems with the X-axis labels. I will try to fix this in the future. 
Overall, it seems to estimate it well.

In fact, if we plot our series while imposing 2 standard deviations, we observe the following.

```{r}
plot(gfit, which=1)
```

This seems to capture it very well.

However, I would like to make sure it captured all the autocorrelation. To do this, I will plot the ACF and PCF of the residuals. 

```{r}
gfit@fit$residuals %>% acf
gfit@fit$residuals %>% pacf
```

It looks like we captured the immediate effects, but we might still be missing some extra effect. I'll explore this in further detail later.

I will continue to update this section. However, my initial thoughts about the tidyquant package are very positive. It's great to be able to work the functions into a pipeline and I will be sure to explore the portfolio capabilities as well in the future.
